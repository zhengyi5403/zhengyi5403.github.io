It's a very sudden thought.

I start a personal blog,

only write by myself,

and only use English.

It's about all my life.

From my born

To the last if I can.

Today when I search something about software architect,

I went to this blog <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/marcod/" target="_blank">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/marcod/</a><br />then I saw a blog named "After 18 years posting"

it's quite shack me.

I want be a man like him.

don't need post every day.

but post 18 years and more.

let's go.
